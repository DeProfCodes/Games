# Games

This is a long overdue repository. The games have been stored safely in a goodle drive up until now. 

These are the games I created just right after I completed my first year in University. 

First game is Tetris (need some GUI fixes). This I created in December 2016. Creating the game was me trying to put my idea in real life. I never improved the code since then.

Second game is Pacman, created in 2017 January.
